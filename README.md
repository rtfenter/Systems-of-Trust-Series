# Systems of Trust Series  
### Applied governance, event integrity, and system truth

This series collects my work on systems of trust — where distributed systems, events, and human decision-making meet.  
It includes essays, diagrams, and small technical projects exploring how systems maintain coherence, truth, and alignment across teams, services, and time.

My goal: translate abstract trust & governance concepts into practical tools and artifacts that engineers, PMs, and data teams can reason with.

## Purpose of This Series  

Trust in distributed systems isn’t just about uptime or retries. It emerges from:

- clear event contracts and shared language  
- safe handling of exceptions without losing integrity  
- traceable ownership and observability to prevent drift  
- routing and boundaries that behave the way teams think they do  

This series aims to make that trust **legible** and **actionable** through essays, diagrams, and small, high-signal prototypes.

---

## Why This Matters for Product Strategy

Trust is a product problem long before it becomes an engineering problem.

Stronger contracts, cleaner governance, and clearer ownership boundaries lead directly to:

- **fewer incidents** caused by silent mismatches and schema drift  
- **faster integrations** between teams, markets, and external partners  
- **less data corruption** and fewer analytics/ML inconsistencies  
- **safer compliance and privacy posture**, grounded in explicit boundaries  
- **greater platform extensibility**, because new features don’t break old ones  

These prototypes are not engineering artifacts — they are product tools that help teams see, reason about, and align on system truth before it becomes expensive to fix.

## Product Architecture Philosophy

Every system carries an implicit philosophy — a shape that determines what breaks, what drifts, and what stays coherent under pressure.

My approach to product architecture is built on three principles:

1. **Meaning is a first-class API**  
   Systems fail when teams stop agreeing on what things mean.  
   Product’s role is to preserve shared definitions across services, versions, and time.

2. **Governance is design, not documentation**  
   Boundaries, contracts, invariants, and ownership rules are part of the product surface — not an afterthought or a Confluence page.

3. **Trust scales when friction scales predictably**  
   Healthy systems bend without fracturing.  
   Architecture succeeds when exceptions, upgrades, and integrations behave the way teams expect.

This series expresses that philosophy through tools, diagrams, and small artifacts that make invisible system behaviors visible.

## Writing  
A curated selection of essays exploring governance, event contracts, drift, and system truth.

- **[Designing for Truth: Event Contracts as Product Design](https://medium.com/@rtfenter/designing-for-truth-event-contracts-as-product-design-bf9e1feb9189)**  
- **[Designing Flexibility Without Drift: The Real Work of Exception Handling](https://medium.com/@rtfenter/exceptions-not-excuses-designing-systems-that-bend-without-breaking-b1c7c7fe177c)**  
- **[When Data Wanders Off](https://medium.com/@rtfenter/when-data-wanders-off-d34e8dabb2cd)**  

### Coming Next
- **Making Drift Visible** — audits, parity checks  
  *Systems must remember what they were built to mean.*  

- **The Spike Test** — signal vs noise, responsible diagnosis  
  *Interpretation before reaction = coherence.*  

- **When Success Breaks You** — scaling, feedback, self-learning architecture  
  *Stability and learning are recursive, not opposite.*

## Projects  
These projects each have their own repo and contribute to the broader Systems of Trust portfolio.

## System Diagrams  
These diagrams illustrate how trust behaves inside distributed systems.

### Event Contract Flow — From Producer to Consumers

    [Producer Service]
          |
          v
    [Event Created]
      - name
      - schema version
      - required fields
          |
          v
    [Contract Validator]
      - field presence & types
      - enums / invariants
      - domain-specific rules
          |
          v
    [Event Bus / Stream]
          |
          v
    [Consumers]
      - services
      - analytics
      - ML
      - audits

    If the contract is weak here,
    every downstream system negotiates its own “truth”.

### Truth Drift Map — Services & Versions

              [Canonical Definition]
             (event + meaning + invariants)
                         |
         ----------------------------------------
         |                  |                  |
         v                  v                  v
     [Service A]        [Service B]        [Service C]
      v1, v2             v1 only            v2 + local enum

    Examples:
    - Service A adds new enum values
    - Service B never upgrades schema
    - Service C reuses a field for a new concept

    Result:
    - different meanings for the same field name
    - broken joins, inconsistent analytics
    - incidents that are “interpretation disputes”
      instead of clear facts

---

### Schema Evolution Impact View

    [Schema v1]
      - fields: A, B, C
      - types: string, int, enum

        |
        |  (proposed change)
        v

    [Schema v2]
      - A -> renamed to A_id
      - B -> type int → string
      - D -> new required field

    Downstream Services:

    - Service X
        expects A, B
        breaks on rename + type change

    - Service Y
        ignores A
        optional read of C
        safe, but may miss new D semantics

    - Service Z
        strict validator on v1
        treats v2 as invalid and drops events

    Impact:
    - silent drops
    - partial upgrades
    - version skew across the estate

### Routing & Boundary Overview

                   [Incoming Event]
                           |
                           v
                [Routing Rules & Filters]
                - field-based conditions
                - version-aware checks
                - region / consent logic
                           |
          ------------------------------------
          |                  |               |
          v                  v               v
     [Topic A]          [Queue B]       [Drop / DLQ]

    In parallel:

    [Ownership Map]
    - Who owns each field?
    - Which systems are allowed to see it?
    - Where does it become a privacy, legal,
      or domain boundary violation?

    Trust lives where routing logic
    and ownership boundaries stay aligned.

## About This Repo  
This repository is the **series hub** for Systems of Trust — writing, diagrams, prototypes, and system models.

---

## Technologies Used

These prototypes are intentionally lightweight — fast to build, easy to fork, and simple to reason about.

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**  
- **GitHub Pages for static hosting**  
- **No backend required**  

The goal is clarity, not complexity: high-signal tools that communicate system behavior without infrastructure overhead.
